### Overview
Fedora Workstation is Fedora’s official desktop edition.  
It provides a powerful, easy to use desktop experience.  
Workstation is intended to be a great general purpose desktop.  
It also aims to be a fantastic platform for software developers.  

Workstation is part of the Fedora project.  
As such, it shares components, tools, and processes with other Fedora Editions and Spins.  
However, Workstation is also an independent project, which is able to make its own design and technical decisions, and is a distinct product of its own.  

The Workstation Working Group is the team that has responsibility for Fedora Workstation.  
However, Workstation wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of teams and individuals across the entire Fedora community.  

#### System Requirements
To have a good experience, hardware with a 40GB SSD disk and 4GB RAM is recommended for Fedora Workstation.  
However, it is possible to use hardware with lower specifications.  

Workstation images are available for x86_64 and aarch64 architectures, providing support for Intel, AMD and ARM processors.  

#### What’s Included
Workstation is built from open source components, many of which are shared with other Fedora Editions and Spins.  
Key components include the Linux kernel, systemd, DNF, the Wayland display server, the Pipewire multimedia server, NetworkManager, the GNOME Desktop, and the Firefox browser.  
Each of these components are carefully integrated and tested, to work together as part of a seamless experience.  

Workstation also includes a default set of preinstalled applications, to make it easy to get started, and to provide the range of standard utilities that are necessary for a desktop.  

In order to prevent Workstation systems from becoming unusable, certain key components are required to be installed, and cannot be removed.  
These non-removable components include gnome-shell, gnome-control-center, grub, and NetworkManager.
